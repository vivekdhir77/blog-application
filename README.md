# blog-application-:
This is a responsive basic blog application built using html and css which contains 3 pages 
1. Index

3. About developers

## how is this useful-: 
Anybody can use the repo to get a basic frame/layout for their blog applicatoin and if they have enough knowledge on how html works they use it to write blogs and publish them 

## website layout-: 

The index page consists of what the blog would be about and the latest blog publish by the author 

Then we have the blogs page where the author can publish his/her blogs and the viewers can visit the website to read the blogs. 

In the end we have the about developers page where people can contact us and give us feedback regarding our project.
